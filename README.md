# processing_the_world_around_me

The purpose of this project is to document the things I learn and explore through Daniel Shiffman's Processing tutorials. I like his temperament, and I love The Nature of Code, which I've never fully read but love so far. My knowledge of Processing is deficient, though, and it makes following The Nature of Code too difficult. I'm going to begin by learning Processing through the videos, then move on to The Nature of Code.
