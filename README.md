# processing_the_world_around_me

The purpose of this project is to document the things I learn and explore while following along with Daniel Shiffman's Processing tutorials. I like his temperament, and I love The Nature of Code, which I've never fully read but have enjoyed so far. My knowledge of Processing is deficient, though, so following The Nature of Code is more difficult as a consequence. I'm going to begin by learning Processing through the videos, then move on to The Nature of Code.
