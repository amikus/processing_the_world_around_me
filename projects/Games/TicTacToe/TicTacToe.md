Just a run-of-the-mill Tic Tac Toe game, which I'm using to play with two-dimensional arrays.

Some aspects I'd like to develop further and improve:

* I would like to add a "Reset" button so that the board can be erased, and the game can be played again. 
* No win condition exists for the game. Ideally, when a player wins, a message would display, and an animation would draw a line through the winning pieces. 
* With a win condition, and the ability to reset the game, a scoreboard should also exist.
* I'd also like the players to be able to see which player's turn is active.

Opportunities for continued learning and research:

* I have not explored networked games yet. This game seems like it would provide a relatively simple context in which to implement an online game. Eventually, I could even add an account, login, and match-making system.
