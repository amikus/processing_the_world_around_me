so much depends  
upon

a gray flat  
ball

glazed with refreshed  
pixels

beside the git console  
window

![A bouncing ball](BouncingBall.gif)

The most difficult part of this sketch was coaxing the ball to behave in a realistic way as it came to a halt. This is honest in a way, but it's not a true model of real-world physics. Like a painting or a poem, it captures some truths of motion but without all the axioms nailed down.

Some ideas to explore later:

* Allow the user to:
    * Restart the ball's descent
	* Add additional balls
	* Change the initial speed and bounciness of the ball
* Could be interesting if I combined this with the random circle sketch, generating an endless number of balls of random colors and sizes, at random positions. Perhaps these would collect along the bottom of the window or would continue to bounce forever.
