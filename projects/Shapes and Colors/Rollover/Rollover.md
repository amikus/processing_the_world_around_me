The sketches in this folder explore the idea of a rollover, a shape or region of the screen that responds in some way when the user's mouse passes over it.

This basic rollover feature is fundamental to many two-dimensional user interfaces. A designer can clearly communicate boundaries of affordance by determining which objects on the screen change when the mouse hovers over them.

The first sketch contains two simples shapes--a rectancle and a circle. The shapes change color when the user positions the mouse within their boundaries.
